# This project imports raw daily data from GitHub, arrange it in daily DataFrames, and combine all data in 
# a large (160MB, as of April 26, 2021) DataFrame.
#
# The program then anable the user to plot (and print) statistics for any country/region.
# This project was an exercize in the Data Scientist course in John Bryce academy (Tel Aviv, Israel), on Nov-2019 to Jan-2021.
# 
# The program include three files: oveds_mail, oveds_acc.py, and oveds_func.py.
#
# To run the program, use Python and run oveds_main.py. Allow the program to upload and process all 
# data from GitHub. It will store two files on your frame: raw_data.p and cleaned_data.p.
# On the next run, it will just update these file on new data (since the last run).
